A Facebook Chat Client implemented in Java.

# ATTENTION!! #

Facebook Chat has switched its protocol to XMPP/Jabber.
So any third party IM client (such as Pidgin, SIP Communicator, iChat, Adium, Digsby, gajim) that support XMPP will work. We don't need to hack the protocol anymore.
So...this project is **_deprecated_**. :(


# ATTENTION!! #

This project is just for testing the implementation of Facebook Chat support for [SIP Communicator](http://www.sip-communicator.org/), so please don't put too much trust on this program, though it can also work properly in most cases.

~~AND: The featured executable zip package(Version 1.00) only works well in the condition that the account's using **"old"**-layout pages, not the **new** layout pages. The latter is supported by the newest code in the trunk.~~(Now supported by version 1.1)
